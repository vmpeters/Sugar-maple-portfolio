Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest: Sugar Maple Seedling Growth Analysis
Overview

This project analyzes ecological data from the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, investigating how environmental factors influence the growth of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) seedlings. Over decades, acid deposition has depleted soil calcium, affecting forest health. The analysis focuses on how calcium treatment and elevation impact seedling stem length, combining statistical rigor with actionable ecological insights.

Motivation

Understanding the drivers of forest growth is essential for ecosystem management, environmental conservation, and public health applications. This project demonstrates applied skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization, showcasing the ability to generate insights from complex, real-world datasets.

Dataset

Source: Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (2003–2004)

Observations: 359 sugar maple seedlings

Key Variables:

stem_length: Seedling height in millimeters (numeric response)

watershed: Treatment group – calcium-treated (W1) vs. untreated (Reference)

elevation: Elevation zone – low (500–550m), mid (550–600m), high (600–650m, labeled NA)

Methods

Data Cleaning: Ensured consistent variable formatting, handled missing values, and validated data integrity.

Exploratory Analysis: Visualized distributions of stem length across watershed treatments and elevation zones using density ridge plots and boxplots.

Statistical Modeling: Conducted one-way ANOVA to test whether mean stem length differed by watershed treatment or elevation zone. Verified assumptions of normality and equal variance before analysis.

Tools & Libraries: R (tidyverse for data manipulation, ggridges for visualization, car for ANOVA).

Results

Seedlings in calcium-treated watersheds had significantly greater stem lengths than those in untreated watersheds, highlighting the positive ecological impact of calcium supplementation.

Elevation alone did not significantly influence seedling growth, suggesting that treatment effects outweigh altitude effects in this context.

Visualizations confirmed these findings, with distinct distributions across treatments and consistent trends across elevations.

Conclusions

The analysis demonstrates that calcium treatment plays a critical role in enhancing sugar maple growth, supporting prior ecological research. Elevation had minimal impact in this dataset. This project highlights the importance of careful data handling, exploratory analysis, and rigorous statistical testing to draw actionable conclusions from ecological studies.

Future Directions

Expand the analysis to additional years or other forest plots for broader ecological insights.

Explore other growth metrics, including biomass, leaf area, or chlorophyll content.

Apply predictive modeling or machine learning approaches to forecast seedling growth under varying environmental conditions.
